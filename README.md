# Build Tests With:

At top-level directory (Eventually implement test script with Python)

```
gcc tests\func_test.c -o [OUTPUT] -I lib
```

# TODO

* Create a makefile for compilation (Both gnu make and windows nmake)
* Needed: [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) for implementing rationals and integers quickly and basically.
* Switch to Projective or Jacobian coordinates
